| №<br>загрози | Назва зв’язку | STRIDE-клас загрози | Назва загрози | Опис загрози |
|--------------|:-------------:|:-------------------:|:-------------:|:------------:|
| 1 | SyncReader-GoogleTranslate-Request | Elevation of Privileges | An adversary may jail break into a mobile device and gain elevated privileges | An adversary may jail break into a mobile device and gain elevated privileges |
| 2 | SyncReader-GoogleTranslate-Request | Elevation of Privileges | An adversary may gain unauthorized access to Web API due to poor access control checks | An adversary may gain unauthorized access to Web API due to poor access control checks |
| 3 | SyncReader-GoogleTranslate-Request | Information Disclosure | An adversary can gain access to sensitive information from an API through error messages | An adversary can gain access to sensitive data such as the following, through verbose error messages - Server names - Connection strings - Usernames - Passwords - SQL procedures - Details of dynamic SQL failures - Stack trace and lines of code - Variables stored in memory - Drive and folder locations - Application install points - Host configuration settings - Other internal application details  |
| 4 | SyncReader-GoogleTranslate-Request | Information Disclosure | An adversary can gain access to sensitive data by sniffing traffic from Mobile client | An adversary can gain access to sensitive data by sniffing traffic from Mobile client |
| 5 | SyncReader-GoogleTranslate-Request | Information Disclosure | An adversary can gain access to sensitive data by sniffing traffic to Web API | An adversary can gain access to sensitive data by sniffing traffic to Web API |
| 6 | SyncReader-GoogleTranslate-Request | Information Disclosure | An adversary can gain sensitive data from mobile device | If application saves sensitive PII or HBI data on phone SD card or local storage, then it ay get stolen. |
| 7 | SyncReader-GoogleTranslate-Request | Information Disclosure | An adversary can gain access to sensitive data stored in Web API's config files | An adversary can gain access to the config files. and if sensitive data is stored in it, it would be compromised. |
| 8 | SyncReader-GoogleTranslate-Request | Repudiation | Attacker can deny a malicious act on an API leading to repudiation issues | Attacker can deny a malicious act on an API leading to repudiation issues |
| 9 | SyncReader-GoogleTranslate-Request | Spoofing | An adversary obtains refresh or access tokens from Mobile Client SyncReader and uses them to obtain access to the Google Translate API API | On a public client (e.g. a mobile device), refresh tokens may be stolen and used by an attacker to obtain access to the API. Depending on the client type, there are different ways that tokens may be revealed to an attacker and therefore different ways to protect them, some involving how the software using the tokens requests, stores and refreshes them. |
| 10 | SyncReader-GoogleTranslate-Request | Spoofing | An adversary may spoof Mobile Client SyncReader and gain access to Web API | If proper authentication is not in place, an adversary can spoof a source process or external entity and gain unauthorized access to the Web Application  |
| 11 | SyncReader-GoogleTranslate-Request | Tampering | An adversary may inject malicious inputs into an API and affect downstream processes | An adversary may inject malicious inputs into an API and affect downstream processes |
| 12 | SyncReader-GoogleTranslate-Request | Tampering | An adversary can reverse engineer and tamper binaries | An adversary can use various tools, reverse engineer binaries and abuse them by tampering |
| 13 | SyncReader-GoogleTranslate-Request | Tampering | An adversary can gain access to sensitive data by performing SQL injection through Web API | SQL injection is an attack in which malicious code is inserted into strings that are later passed to an instance of SQL Server for parsing and execution. The primary form of SQL injection consists of direct insertion of code into user-input variables that are concatenated with SQL commands and executed. A less direct attack injects malicious code into strings that are destined for storage in a table or as metadata. When the stored strings are subsequently concatenated into a dynamic SQL command, the malicious code is executed.  |
